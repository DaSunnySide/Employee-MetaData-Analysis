# Employee-MetaData-Analysis

A boilerplate project in C# Designed to serve as a Data Mining Project that aims to provide metadata about users to the users
for self-improvement. The project is designed around the military concept that every soldier is also a leader, which makes
modeling the system very easy, since each soldier can have a property that defines their leaders and their suboordinates.
